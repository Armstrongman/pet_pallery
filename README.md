# Pet Pallery

Pet Pallery is a mobile application that will be specifically designed for pet owners and will allow them to do various things on the app. They will be able to post about their animals and allow other people to see those images and videos of said animals. So, in essence, this app will basically be a social media platform specifically for pet owners, but that will not be its only intended purpose and function though. People will also be allowed to give away animals on an adoption tab in the app. This will then allow other people to request to become an adoptee of a certain animal they may be looking at. Users may then be able to get into contact with each other to discuss these matters privately. It can help solve the issue of cutting out the middleman of an animal shelter and can allow for people to discuss a transaction from owner to owner. These two functions of the app will be the most important features and will be the most valuable things to complete to ensure the app works as intended.
